	<h1>Hi, I'm Marie üåû</h1>

	<h2>I'm looking for new opportunities and adventures</h2>

	<p>Let me introduce myself : I'm Marie, a 21-year old <span class="vert">Digital Marketing student</span> at IESEG School of Managemement in Lille. I am from Angers, a nice town in the West of France. Since childhood, I have always been <span class="vert">active and passionate.</span> It started at 8, when I won a regional cooking contest in the kitchens of a starred restaurant. Then I created a gymnastics club in my college, raised funds for the association Imagime for Margo in my high school, donated my hair for women suffering from cancer and integrated my Business school Junior-Entreprise  as a project Manager. Last summer, I have finally been recruited at the <span class="vert">Head of the Training Department</span> at the French National Confederetation of Junior-Entreprises. As you can imagine, <span class="jaune">engagement</span> is very important for me.</p>
	<p>For my second year of Master, I am willing to take a new challenge : support a company for 6 moths through a <span class="jaune">Consulting project.</span></p>

	<h2>My Consulting Project with you üçÄ</h2>
	<p>As my school describes it, a Consulting project is the <span class="jaune">opportunity</span> :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>for a company to gather <span class="jaune">an innovative and external view</span> on its activities</li>
			<li>for a student to perform <span class="jaune">a deep and rich analysis</span> of a company's activities to get prepared to tomorrow professional challenges</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>As I am aware of the different issues our world is facing, I am willing to perform my Consulting project in a firm that makes efforts to adapt its business model to <span class="vert">sustainability</span> in a sector full of challenges : the agri-food.</p>

	<h2>Agri food and retail interests üè≠</h2>
		<p>It is important for me to work in a sector people depend on. What is best than the sector that makes the entire population live everyday ? At the centre of our society, <span class="jaune">agri-food is essential to our lives.</span> The sector is also facing many issues such as climate change and soaring demography.</p>
